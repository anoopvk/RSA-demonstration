                                    RSA algorithm is asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric actually means that
                                    it
                                    works
                                    on
                                    two different keys i.e. Public Key and Private Key. As the name describes that the
                                    Public
                                    Key is
                                    given to everyone and Private key is kept private.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The idea of RSA is based on the fact that it is difficult to factorize a large
                                    integer. The public key consists of two numbers where one number is multiplication
                                    of two large prime numbers. And private key is also derived from the same two prime
                                    numbers. So if somebody can factorize the large number, the private key is
                                    compromised. Therefore encryption strength totally lies on the key size and if we
                                    double or triple the key size, the strength of encryption increases exponentially.
                                    RSA keys can be typically 1024 or 2048 bits long, but experts believe that 1024 bit
                                    keys could be broken in the near future. But till now it seems to be an infeasible
                                    task.

                                    However, since this is made for demonstration purposes, keys of small sizes are
                                    used.
